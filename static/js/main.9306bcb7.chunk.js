It is similar to the Royale grind, but you\'re only grinding with your back skate. It is difficult because it\'s a fast grind and very easy to slip out of.","Jumping into it you must have confidence that you\'re locking it with your weight already properly distributed. You\'re balancing the weight of your body on a very small area in the groove of your frame, and for a more advanced version you can squat down with your leg and lock the trick on the groove of your frame and the groove in your soul plate.","If you\'re going to slip out of this grind you are most likely falling backwards (i.e. your grinding skate will slip forward and you\'re falling like a tree on your back) so watch out for that when trying to balance this one out.","A good approach for learning this one is to have a solid Royale and then slowly start transferring more weight on your back leg while trying to lift your front leg off the grinding surface."],"altText":"Rollerblader doing a backslide grind on a ledge.","imageURIs":["https://www.stevenwolpe.com/bfg-images/grinds/Backslide_01.jpg","https://www.stevenwolpe.com/bfg-images/grinds/Backslide_02.jpg","https://www.stevenwolpe.com/bfg-images/grinds/Backslide_03.jpg","https://www.stevenwolpe.com/bfg-images/grinds/Backslide_04.jpg","https://www.stevenwolpe.com/bfg-images/grinds/Backslide_05.jpg","https://www.stevenwolpe.com/bfg-images/grinds/Backslide_06.jpg"]},{"id":"15","type":"grind","name":"Cab Driver","desc":["Sliding a torque and backslide at the same time without crossing your legs.
