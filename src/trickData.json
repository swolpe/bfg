Even though it is a beginner grind it requires a full commit - you want both of your skates to be up in the air and lock to the grind relatively at the same time, otherwise you risk slipping out.","The Frontside grind defines your body position towards the element you are grinding, and in technicality it also defines this position as the position of other groove grinds. In this grind you are facing the object with the front of your body, your legs spread apart, and you are locking both skates on the (inner) groove in your frame.","The control of this grind is mainly in your knees, and you're trying to balance your body evenly between your feet. You will need to develop certain muscle groups to preform this grind well but it is very helpful in transitioning to other Groove grinds, as well as Soul grinds. The more you spread your legs apart, and the lower you go, the harder the grind gets."],
